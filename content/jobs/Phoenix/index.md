My responsibilities start with working closely with our customers to capture software requirements, analysis of the requirements, and providing an accurate design estimate and quote. As I complete the software design, I continue to work with the customer providing prototypes and receiving feedback to ensure I’m meeting the customer’s needs and expectations. As I complete the software development I ensure proper quality with testing and customer deployment. Since I'm working with customers that wish to fill an immediate need, the quality and time-to-market are essential for each application produced. The following are some of the key software features I have completed for customers:

- Window-based GUI written in python to interacting with DBase databases.
- Window-based web server written in python to control and communicate serially with a microcontroller.
- iPhone application to interface and control microcontroller via client/server framework.
- Applications with proprietary PDF table extraction written in both C++ and python 2.
- Window-based GUI written in python to decode proprietary binary data streams.
- Window-based GUI to view, modify, and generate proprietary configuration data for CNC machine tools.
